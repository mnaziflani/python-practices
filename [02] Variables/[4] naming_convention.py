"""
Naming conventions are a set of guidelines that developers follow to make their code more readable and maintainable. Different programming languages often have different naming conventions. In python, variables are written in snake case - words are separated by underscores.
When writing a variable name be descriptive and use meaningful words

For example:
"""

# Bad Naming
isActive = False # not snake case
a = 10
b = "Hello"
x = True

# Good Naming
age = 10
greeting = "Hello"
is_active = True
