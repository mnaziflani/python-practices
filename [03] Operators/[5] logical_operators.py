"""
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

Python has three logical operators:

and
or
not
Let's see how the and operator works:

The and operator returns True if both statements are true.

# Create two boolean variables
x = True
y = True

# Check if both x and y are True
result = x and y
After executing the above code, result contains:

True
If one of the values is False, the result will be False:

# Create two boolean variables
x = True
y = False

# Check if both x and y are True
result = x and y
This gives us:

False
