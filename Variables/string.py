A char is a single character (for example: 1, 6, %, b, p, ., T, etc.)
The str (string) type is a special type that consists of multiple chars.
To initialize a string value in a variable, enclose it within single or double quotation marks:

s1 = 'This is a string'
s2 = "This is also a string"
In the above example, two string variables are initialized, named s1 and s2.
