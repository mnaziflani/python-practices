Write code that initializes the following variables:

k with the value 88 (note: lowercase 'k')
PI with the value 3.14 (note: uppercase 'PI')
name with the value “Bob”.

Make sure you use the exact variable names and values. Remember:
Python is case-sensitive! (k ≠ K)
String values must be enclosed in quotes: "bob" not bob
