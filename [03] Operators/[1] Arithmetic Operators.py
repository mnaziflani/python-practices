"""
Operators are used to perform operations on values.

First we will discuss the most basic arithmetic operators, they may be familiar from math classes.

Operator	Operation	Example
+	Addition	3 + 2 = 5
-	Subtraction	3 - 2 = 1
*	Multiplication	3 * 2 = 6
/	Division	4 / 2 = 2
Let's see a usage example.

a = 3
b = 5
c = a + b # c holds 8
"""

# Type your code below
a = 5
b = 10
c = 20
total = a + b + c

# Don't change the line below
print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}")
print(f"total value(+) = {total}")
