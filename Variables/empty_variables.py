"""
In Python, None is a special value that represents "nothing" or "no value." It's like an empty box - it exists, but there's nothing inside it. For example:

empty_box = None
In a real scenario you could use None to indicate that something was not initialized yet.

For example:

score = None  # Score hasn't been calculated yet
name = None   # Name hasn't been entered yet
