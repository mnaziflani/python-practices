"""
In Python, you can combine multiple conditions using logical operators (and, or, not) to create more complex expressions.

Let's create a condition that checks if a number is both positive and even:

number = 6
Now let's check if the number is positive:

is_positive = number > 0
Let's also check if the number is even:

is_even = number % 2 == 0
We can combine these conditions using the and operator:

result = is_positive and is_even
This evaluates to True because 6 is both positive and even.

For a more direct approach, you can combine conditions without intermediate variables:

result = number > 0 and number % 2 == 0
Similarly, you can use the or operator to check if at least one condition is true:

number = -4
is_negative_or_odd = number < 0 or number % 2 != 0

# Write code that checks if a person is eligible to drive.

    # The person is at least 18 years old
    # The person has a license
    # The person has insurance

# Your program should:
    # Read an integer age from the first line of input
    # Read a string has_license from the second line of input (either "true" or "false")
    # Read a string has_insurance from the third line of input (either "true" or "false")
    # Convert the license and insurance inputs to boolean values
    # Check all three conditions and store the result in a variable named result
    # Print the final result (should be True or False)

age = int(input("Enter age: "))
has_license = input().lower() == "true"
has_insurance = input().lower() == "true" # How does this work? Meaning how does it convert into boolean value and not a string?


# Complete this line to check if all conditions are met
result = has_license  and age >= 18 and has_insurance

print(result)
