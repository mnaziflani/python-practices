"""
A bool (Boolean) type has only 2 possible values: True or False.
Here is an example of assigning a bool value to a variable:

variable_true = True
variable_false = False

In the above, two variables named variable_true and variable_false are initialized, with the values True and False respectively.
Booleans are the building blocks for creating logic in the programs we write. We have a whole chapter about logic and conditions.

# Type your code below

# Don't change the line below
trueorfalse = 2 > 5
print(f'boolean = {boolean}')
print(f'trueorfalse = {trueorfalse}')
