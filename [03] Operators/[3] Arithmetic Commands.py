"""
Python created a cool shortcut for self-arithmetic operations.

For example, instead of writing:

a = 5
a = a + 3 # a holds 8
We can simplify it by writing +=:

a = 5
a += 3 # a holds 8
The += operator adds the value 3 to a.

This operation is valid for all arithmetic operations:

Operator	Shortcut
+	+=
-	-=
*	*=
/	/=
%	%=

a = 50
a += 5
print(a)
