"""
Variables are containers that hold data values. They are used to store, manipulate, and display information within a program.
In short, a variable is like a memory unit that we can access by typing the name of the variable.

Each variable has a unique name and a value that can be of different types. Python is capable of automatically detecting the variable type, which makes coding more efficient.
To initialize a variable, we use the following format:

variable_name = value
Let's take a look at the different types of numbers:

int - whole number, such as 1 or -2.
float - real number, such as 1.32 or 0.98.

For example:
To initialize a variable of type int with the name a and the value 3:
a = 3

To initialize a variable of type float with the name b and the value 13.2:
b = 13.2

# Type your code below
var = 20
store_number = 100.5
# Don't change the line below
print(f'var = {var}')
print(store_number)
